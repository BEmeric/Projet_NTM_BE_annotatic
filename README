I wrote a new version of annotatic from scratch because Alice's version
was buggy and had too many defects.

While doing so I identified several problems and fixed them, eg:
problem with ID line (have to select relevant OIDs), problem
with OPOS too big, etc...


annotatic_alice.pl : Alice's "final" krakenator version.

annotatic_ntm_150915.pl : initial version deployed at IBP yesterday,
however I then made some changes directly on the IonServer, eg path
customizations.
 
annotatic_IBP_150915.pl: customized version for the IBP IonServer,
with small improvements over annotatic_ntm_150915.pl .


annotatic_ntm_150916.pl : updated version (fixing COSM and some other 
rare issues, improved comments and code structure), and also merging in
the changes between annotatic_ntm_150915.pl and annotatic_IBP_150915.pl .
Now all changes needed when deploying at IBP are three global vars in
the first section of the code, commented "IBP".


annotatic_fromIBP_150917.pl : version from IBP where I had fixed a bunch 
of issues online. Not sure what this was based on...

annotatic_ntm_150922.pl : fixed a few things for IBP, eg the csv file
should be called .txt otherwise they have issues opening it in excel (!!!),
and many die's are replaced by warnings because the unexpected does happen
and we don't want to kill the plugin.

annotatic_IBP_150922.pl: same as above but with the few IBP customizations.

annotatic_ntm_151019.pl: change $genome_fasta to non-gzipped version to make
HGVS work, update $NM_file, and fixed a bug due to splicing when a genotype
call calls hetero for two different alt alleles (ie no ref allele).


annotatic_ntm_151022.pl: ignore the OPOS skipping method because too many FNs.

annotatic_ntm_151117.pl: replace %3D with = (for HGVS synonymous SNPs); and fix step3
so that when there are no variants we skip infile instead of dying.

annotatic_ntm_160322.pl: code cleanup (remove the OPOS skipping code which was no
longer used=); disguise VCF lines coming from GATK for long-indels so they look
like "normal" FreeBayes lines (mainly: add F to DP et al fields, see STEP 1B);
consider OID+OMAPALT as optional (don't skip if they are not there).

annotatic_ntm_BE_260516.pl: recovering of original variants (OALT) and original 
reference (OREF); then it's important to grab good oalt and good oref in respective 
fields and in correct position if we want to have  right annotation from VEP. 
Same thing was done for OPOS's value which give the good position of orignial variant.  
See STEP 1C from line 267 to line 297 and from line 314 to 346.
And in STEP 1E from line 392, we also display in (file)_clean.vcf the good values of 
good OPOS, OALT and OREF.

annotatic_ntm_BE_270516.pl: put the allelic frequencies in percent (see line 412 
in STEP 1E).
In hgvs's fields, the NM annotations are removed; same to the MAF's annotations. 
(see in STEP 3 from line 579 to line 601)
Following step, make interface which interact with annotatic and allow to choose 
annotation's fields of interest. 


annotatic_ntm_BE_160712.pl: reworked annotatic_ntm_BE_160527.pl: restructured/validated BE's
changes, fixed a few things. Committed to github.
